  "Code Crew is a team dedicated to participating in hackathons and coding competitions. Our mission is to bridge the gap for students in tier 3 colleges who focus primarily on web development and other tech stacks, but often don't have the opportunity to apply their skills to real-world problems. Many students are unaware of hackathons or lack the right team to participate.";
const para2 =
  "Weâ€™ve created a community of coders who collaborate on hackathons and competitive programming challenges, giving students the chance to gain hands-on experience. Building an impressive resume can be tough, as good internships are scarce and hard to secure. Hackathons, however, offer an excellent opportunity to not only strengthen your skills but also to showcase your teamwork and problem-solving abilities, making your resume stand out.";
